# Annotated Bibliography

## From GHC Wiki

* https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/wikis/plugins/type-checker

The current home

* https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/wikis/reading-list#types-and-type-inference

This looks like a nice list. (1) Is it out-of-date? (2) Is there a few paragraphs we could tell to orient all of those papers with respect to one another?

* https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/wikis/commentary/compiler/type-checker

Probably out of date. Not much narrative, mostly just terse high-level descriptions and "this source file defines that types/function". In particular, only says "The best place reading for the constraint solver is the paper Modular type inference with local assumptions".

* https://github.com/xnning/GHC-Core-Literature-Review/blob/master/doc/doc.pdf

A somewhat short list. Seems like it gives non-negligible notes about each. It's about features of the type system, but not the constraint solver. Looks like that is primarily just OutsideIn.pdf at this point (and maybe the QuantifiedContexts paper too, and Chak et al's coercions/fundeps/tyfams too I guess etc, but OutsideIn.pdf seems to cover that pretty well if I understand correctly).

* https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/tree/master/docs%2Fcore-spec

Important, but overwhelmingly dense! Excludes `data Ct`.

* https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/wikis/type-functions

Looks to be 11 years old. Probably inconsistent to varying degrees with current implementation. But large parts might still be relevant. Probably a good bridge from Chak et al's papers and OutsideIn.pdf to the code.
